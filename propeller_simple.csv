Sardinian Pilot rc sailboat 3D printable 78 cm long,"(update) Hi guys, as already indicated in my last work on the J-Class Rainbow, I had to learn how to use the Fusion 360 software well and therefore what better way to learn by drawing something of great interest to me (sailing boats).
Came out a sailing Pilot that I really like in its lines and I was missing in my living room as a model.
I designed it to be able to print it in 3D, divided into 3 sections for medium-sized printers.
Obviously, being an old model maker, I wanted the new technology to marry with the old and therefore the model will have the deck covered with wooden slats and the mast will also be made of wood, and can be customized as desired by whoever wants to build it.
The maneuvers are moved by a closed circuit for the mainsheet and jib sheet, in the printout of the model the pulleys for the circuit and the seats for the servocontrols have been prepared which will only have to be fixed, the propeller shaft has a section of 10 mm of those that are available on the market.
The servo is economic, makes 4 complete turns and its pulley was not good, I redesigned it a little bigger.
The motor seat is also designed for motors that you can recover from old hairdryers or buy, the motor is only for service and not cooled, from tests done it heats little.
Below you will find the STL files for those wishing to try their hand at construction.
For print the 3 sectionof the hull I recommend PLA LW which is much lighter and you can print the hull with 100% infill.My print is in normal Pla but pay attention to the thickness of the hull, it must not have a filling greater than 25% and this could cause water infiltrations. I resolved this with a coat of external epoxy resin, the weight of the 3 sections must be less than 1 kg ( after removing the printing supports.
Obviously being ""in progress"" there will probably be some additions if the construction requires it.
I uploaded a YouTube link where you can see photos of the construction done so far, which will be updated as the work progresses.
STL files are corrected from errors found on the first model to simplify the work.
Check every now and then for changes or additions to files.

A fixed pitch propeller should provide a horizontal flight speed of 20 - 30 m/s, but then in the takeoff and landing mode (vertical speed 0 +/- 5 m/s) this propeller will not be efficient and will require additional motor power.
The presented propeller has a pitch control range of 20 degrees.
Under the condition of a shortage of electrical power on board the aircraft, the drive must be manual and rigid from the pilot's seat.
The drive must provide maximum synchronism for 4/8 propellers. I will try to do it next time."

rc boat - HMS FLIPPER,"HMS FLIPPER is my attempt to build a boat with paddle drive that has become reality.

As a little boy, I had a toy boat to wind up that had a paddle instead of a propeller at the back. I tied it to my grandfather's fishing rod and let it cruise across the small pond. That was much more exciting than waiting for the tiny fish.

HMS FLIPPER looks a bit like the lunch box my grandpa used to keep the earthworms in for fishing - and to make a long story short: The first flipper model made of the colourful PLA parts was leaking. The water penetrated through the printed walls. The second model made of translucent PETG warped so much that I didn't even put it in the water.

Maybe you're still curious enough to try it out for yourselves . . .
And now good luck!

Radial Engine Model,"This demonstration model displays a functional 4-stroke radial engine, which is distinct from a straight-cylinder engine as the cylinders are linked to the crankshaft using a single hub with a master-and-articulating rods assembly. This engine configuration was popular in WWII aircraft due to its reliability and efficiency. Moreover, to ensure a smooth firing order, most 4-stroke radial engines consist of an odd number of cylinders.

The model was constructed based on SPARK PLUG's tutorial on Youtube, which you can find the link to below:

The Shinden was expected to be a highly maneuverable interceptor, but only two prototypes were finished before the end of war. A jet engine–powered version was considered, but never even reached the drawing board.

Its first flight was in early 1944 and it entered service with the Soviet Air Forces later in the year. A small batch of La-7s was given to the Czechoslovak Air Force the following year, but it was otherwise not exported. Armed with two or three 20 mm (0.8 in) cannon, it had a top speed of 661 kilometers per hour (411 mph). The La-7 was felt by its pilots to be at least the equal of any German piston-engined fighter. It was phased out in 1947 by the Soviet Air Force, but served until 1950 with the Czechoslovak Air Force."

3D printed Quadcopter V8,"Summary:
Quadcopter designed to be 3D printed with PLA. Arms are designed to fit into body and to be glued or 3D doodle pen welded into the frame.

Assembly suggestions: 
Glue: suggested (any medium CA glue) the following should also work (epoxy, JB weld, any general purpose gel glue that won't disolve PLA)

Printing:
for best results I suggest splitting the arm body using the motor mount plane. file frame arm holes and arm tabs as required for fit. frame arms can be glued together and then glued into the frame or positioned in the frame and glued all at once. body 23 and 27 are the arms and although I have not checked the arms should be symmetrical so you can print 2x body 23 + 2x body 27 or 4x body 23 or 27. print at which ever settings you typically use for PLA and I used a layer height of 0.12 or 0.15 but use what's best for you. if layer adhesion is bad print a little hotter and use supports. 

suggested motors:
 2205-2300 KV or equivalent with M3 mounting screws

Suggested Propeller:
5x4 or eqivalent


Suggested Battery: 3S-4S battery 850mah or higher 5-7 Min? .3S 18650  7-12 min? MINUMUM DISCHARGE CURRENT RATING FOR ALL BATT TYPES  25A

Yakovlev Yak-3    (1943),"The Yakovlev Yak-3 (Russian: Яковлев Як-3) was a single-engine, single-seat World War II Soviet fighter. Robust and easy to maintain, it was much liked by both pilots and ground crew. One of the smallest and lightest combat fighters fielded by any combatant during the war, its high power-to-weight ratio gave it excellent performance and it proved to be a formidable dogfighter.

Marcel Albert, a World War II French ace who flew the Yak-3 in the USSR with the Normandie-Niémen Group, considered it a superior aircraft to the P-51D Mustang and Supermarine Spitfire. It was also flown by Polish Air Forces (of the Polish People's Army formed in USSR) and the Yugoslav Air Force, after the war.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357435323_Conceptual_Design_of_a_Novel_Roadable_Flying_Car

Nowadays, the importance of zero-emission flying cars has increased as a solution to the traffic problem caused by population growth. In this study, previous flying car concepts in the literature were examined and a conceptual design study of a novel flying car was made. The configuration in which the designed vehicle can achieve maximum efficiency was selected and a design principle was followed accordingly. A survey was conducted with end-users by comparing the vehicle with other concepts in the world. At the same time, the final system architecture of the vehicle and all subsystem components such as electronic communication, chassis, battery management system, power, and propulsion systems were created and designed. In this way, it is aimed to obtain consistent data in mathematical models and analyzes. CFD and static analyzes of the vehicle were made and the data obtained were compared with the numerical analyzes and the vehicle was developed. It has been given importance to reduce the noise of all systems used in the vehicle in terms of passenger comfort and to develop new noise reduction solutions. The reliability of the system is very important due to the innovativeness of the Flying Car (eVTOL) concept. For this reason, the security of all components of the vehicle, cyber-attacks, flight security, and other possible problems have been examined and solutions have been produced. Autopilot systems, GPS, radar, power supply, and other subsystems that can be used on the vehicle are provided with redundancy. Algorithms and different solutions have been produced for issues such as air movement rules of the designed vehicle in today's cities, communication protocols of vehicles, how to get take off the vehicle, how to plan a route, how to react to problems, battery and charging stations."
Bell-Boeing CV-22 Osprey,"The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is an American multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft.

In 1980, the failure of Operation Eagle Claw (during the Iran hostage crisis), underscored that there were military roles for which neither conventional helicopters nor fixed-wing transport aircraft were well-suited. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) initiated a program to develop an innovative transport aircraft, with long-range, high-speed, and vertical-takeoff capabilities; the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) program officially commenced in 1981. A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell Boeing team jointly produces the aircraft.[3] The V-22 first flew in 1989 and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties of being the first tiltrotor for military service led to many years of development.

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) began crew training for the MV-22B Osprey in 2000 and fielded it in 2007; it supplemented and then replaced their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) fielded their version of the tiltrotor, the CV-22B, in 2009. Since entering service with the Marine Corps and Air Force, the Osprey has been deployed in transportation and medevac operations over Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Kuwait. The U.S. Navy plans to use the CMV-22B for carrier onboard delivery duties beginning in 2021."

Nakajima Ki-44,"The Nakajima Ki-44 Shoki (鍾馗, ""Devil Queller"")[2] was a single-seat fighter-interceptor which was developed by the Nakajima Aircraft Company and operated by the Imperial Japanese Army from 1942 to 1945 during World War II. Its official designation is Army Type 2 Single-Seat Fighter (二式単座戦闘機) and its Allied reporting name was Tojo.

The design and development of the Ki-44 differed greatly from that of other Japanese fighters of the time, incorporating speed and rate-of-climb in preference to maneuverability.[3] This was a result of a need for a heavy fighter aircraft that followed a more offensive doctrine and the Ki-44 is often classified as an Air Defence Fighter.[3][4] Its development ran almost in parallel to its predecessor, the lighter and nimble Nakajima Ki-43, and yet the two aircraft differed. The Ki-44 had a higher landing speed and was less maneuverable. These were concerns for pilots who would compare it to the Ki-43 or Ki-27 which were far more agile and responsive. As a result, the Ki-44 was first restricted to pilots with at least 1000 hours of flying time due to its tricky handling characteristics. However, it was later found that younger pilots who had not been instilled with the extensive aerobatic training of earlier cadres could manage the aircraft perfectly well, so the restriction was removed.[3]

Nonetheless, the Ki-44 was the fastest climbing Japanese fighter at the time. It was the Imperial Japanese Army's only interceptor type when the USAAF's B-29 Superfortresses began bombing the Japanese mainland in June 1944.[3][5] While there were performance restrictions at high altitude, it was superior to the Ki-43 in that it was capable of matching Allied aircraft in climbs and dives, giving pilots more flexibility in combat and greater pilot confidence than the Ki-43; the basic armament of four 12.7mm machine guns or two 12.7mm guns and two 20 mm cannons (or, in a few aircraft, two Ho-301 40mm cannons of limited range) was far more powerful than the older Ki-43's two 12.7mm machine guns.[6][7]

Production of the Ki-44 was terminated in late 1944 in favour of the more advanced Nakajima Ki-84, and when the war ended, only three sentai units were still equipped with them.[8]

Piper Cub,"The Piper J-3 Cub is an American light aircraft that was built between 1938 and 1947 by Piper Aircraft. The aircraft has a simple, lightweight design which gives it good low-speed handling properties and short-field performance. The Cub is Piper Aircraft's most-produced model, with nearly 20,000 built in the United States. Its simplicity, affordability and popularity invokes comparisons to the Ford Model T automobile.

The aircraft is a high-wing, strut-braced monoplane with a large-area rectangular wing. It is most often powered by an air-cooled, flat-4 piston engine driving a fixed-pitch propeller. Its fuselage is a welded steel frame covered in fabric, seating two people in tandem.

The Cub was designed as a trainer. It had great popularity in this role and as a general aviation aircraft. Due to its performance, it was well suited for a variety of military uses such as reconnaissance, liaison and ground control. It was produced in large numbers during World War II as the L-4 Grasshopper. Many Cubs are still flying today. Cubs are highly prized as bush aircraft.

The aircraft's standard chrome yellow paint came to be known as ""Cub Yellow"" or ""Lock Haven Yellow""."

Cyclogyro,"This is a concept UAV cyclogyro aircraft. This means that it is a VTOL plane that is propelled by cyclorotors, which are the equivalent of the Voith Schneider propeller in boats. These rotors are capable of achieving higher efficiency at greater speeds than regular propellers, and also produce less noise. Nowadays there aren´t many of this aircraft, just some prototypes from universities, Cyclotech and  D-dalus; and that´s why I tried to design my own aircraft. 
This cyclocopter is a rc aircraft to simplify the design. The cyclorotor has all of the internal components and it moves and works (at least in the Catia assembly), but the internal structure that holds the surface and the internal components is missing, I haven´t designed yet. 
The cyclorotor´s blades use a NACA 0015 airfoil, because many studies that I found say that it is the most efficient one for small size cyclocopters. The main structural plates of the rotor are meant to be made from carbon fiber, and the blades are meant to be 3D printed with an hexagonal infill so that they don’t twist during flight. Over the carbon fiber plates there will be 3D parts that will hold a bearing wherever there is a rotation axis, that has to be placed inside the piece while printing so that it stays inside the PLA piece after the piece is done. This helps reducing the amount of glue and screws used. (https://rotorbuilds.com/pictures/f_4124_TeGlfeA7j5TIcAk81ER3Lrtpx.jpg) <- see example of a PLA piece printed around a carbon arm of an FPV drone. The arm was placed during the process of printing. The bearing size is 7mm because its’s the easiest to buy at local stores. The metallic tubes and connectors are from rc cars connectors because they are stronger than regular rc plane ones (https://www.amazon.es/Rayocon-Actualizaci%C3%B3N-Varilla-Tracci%C3%B3N-Accesorios/dp/B092ZXRPT6/ref=sr_1_11?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=varilla+servo+coche&qid=1630633232&sr=8-11) <- link to see the original ones.

Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress,"The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engined heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps. Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers, the Boeing entry outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps' performance specifications.
The B-17 was primarily employed by the USAAF in the daylight strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial, military and civilian targets. The United States Eighth Air Force, based at many airfields in central, eastern and southern England, and the Fifteenth Air Force, based in Italy, complemented the RAF Bomber Command's night-time area bombing in the Combined Bomber Offensive to help secure air superiority over the cities, factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for the invasion of France in 1944. The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the War in the Pacific, early in World War II, where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields.

From its prewar inception, the USAAC (by June 1941, the USAAF) promoted the aircraft as a strategic weapon; it was a relatively fast, high-flying, long-range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload. It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged B-17s safely returning to base. The B-17 dropped more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War II. Of approximately 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped on Nazi Germany and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft, over 640,000 tons were dropped from B-17s. In addition to its role as a bomber, the B-17 was also employed as a transport, antisubmarine aircraft, drone controller, and search-and-rescue aircraft.

As of October 2019, nine aircraft remain airworthy, though none of them were ever flown in combat. Dozens more are in storage or on static display. The oldest of these is a D-series flown in combat in the Pacific on the first day of World War II."

Cessna 182 Skylane,"The Cessna 182 Skylane is an American four-seat, single-engined light airplane, built by Cessna of Wichita, Kansas. It has the option of adding two child seats, installed in the baggage area.

Introduced in 1956, the 182 has been produced in a number of variants, including a version with retractable landing gear, and is the second-most popular Cessna model still in production, after the 172.



Development
The Cessna 182 was introduced in 1956 as a tricycle gear variant of the 180. In 1957, the 182A variant was introduced along with the name Skylane. As production continued, later models were improved regularly with features such as a wider fuselage, swept tailfin with rear ""omni-vision"" window, enlarged baggage compartment, higher gross weights, landing gear changes, etc. The ""restart"" aircraft built after 1996 were different in many other details including a different engine, new seating design, etc.[citation needed]

By mid-2013, Cessna planned to introduce the next model of the 182T, the JT-A, using the 227 hp (169 kW) SMA SR305-230 diesel engine running on Jet-A with a burn rate of 11 U.S. gallons (42 L; 9.2 imp gal) per hour and cruise at 155 kn (287 km/h).[2][3] Cessna has no timeline for the JT-A and the diesel 172.[4] The normally aspirated, avgas-fueled 182 went out of production in 2012, but came back in 2015.[5]

Cessna 182s were also built in Argentina by DINFIA (called A182), and by Reims Aviation, France, as the F182.

Design
The Cessna 182 is an all-metal (mostly aluminum alloy) aircraft, although some parts – such as engine cowling nosebowl and wingtips – are made of fiberglass or thermoplastic material.

Trebert 5 Cylinder 3.0 Liter Engine,"I took the best elements of a Trebert engine and put them all into a workable model. I've included all of the components including manifolds, pistons, cylinders, lifters, pushrods etc. I didn't include a sealed spark plug wire, but everything else is there. This was designed from scratch in Inventor and I have included files in step, iges and parasolid x_t formats.

Instead of doing a type of Trebert engine where the cylinders rotate, I modified this so that the shaft rotates. Firing order is axial with each piston 72° from the next. Bore = 4"" and stroke = 3""

ENAPTER_ISLANDER,"PLEASE READ THE FULL ABSTRACT BELOW TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'ENAPTER_ISLANDER' : as the name indicates, this concept is for isolated communities around the globe - Such as people living in islands, ships, yachts, submarines etc. The major problems faced by such people are; 
1) - Desalination of sea water
2) - Dependency on main lands for fuel
3) - Electricity
The system will not release any greenhouse gases and it is scalable and manufacturable. It can be directly implemented in islands. We can also use my conceptual windmills (Detailed report of windmill project also attached) for pumping sea water and generating electricity for islands.H2 fuel can be used for vehicles. Plenty of remaining desalinated water and electricity can be used for other purposes.  Where in ships/yachts/submarines, same system can be used by attaching the salt water pump to the propeller shaft, through any clutch and gear drive mechanisms. Thus,  it couples automatically to the propeller shaft when there is a shortage of water in the reservoir tank detected by sensors. So it generate both desalinated water and H2 and store it for later purposes. In ships or submarines, the desalinated water can be used for hydrogen generation for fuel-cells and as cooking gas in emergency situations. Desalinated water can be used in normal situations also. A smaller unit of this system will be helpful for fishermen in emergency situations for desalinated water, electricity and fuel. It is 100% renewable energy, 100% eco-friendly and manufactuarable !! 
In remote areas hydrogen is used in stationary fuel cells for following purposes;
                   4) -  Uninterruptible power supply for hospitals and data centers.
                   5) -  Power for telecommunications in remote locations.
                   6) -  Backup power for regional emergency shelters.
ENAPTER_ISLANDER can be used in Gulf & Mediterranean countries also, as these countries are highly dependent on desalinated water, and have high scope for floating windmills. These region relies heavily on fossil fuel-based thermal desalination. Two-thirds of the water produced from seawater desalination in the region today is from fossil fuel-based thermal desalination, while the rest is from membrane-based desalination that relies heavily on electricity produced using natural gas. It will cause the release of gre..."

Mini DC Brushed Motor,"Most common place to find these motors would be inside children’s toys. Mini brushed motors have very small torque and high speed of rotation, therefore are used for lightweight car toys, lightweight boat toys, small usb fans, electric toothbrushes and as a main component inside small gearmotors. As the name implies, gearmotors are these simple brushed motors combined with a number of gears. The purpose here is to reduce the speed of the rotation and consequently increase the torque of the output shaft. Great learning project here would be to use a mini brushed motor and build your own set of gears, mount them on the shaft and experiment with the output torque and speed, don’t forget to grease the gears to reduce the noise and increase the efficiency.  

Common working voltages for these motors are 3V, 6V and 12V. As with the other motors it’s good practice to separate the current source from the rest of the electronics, to avoid damage caused by back emf. They usually draw 0.3 A - 0.6 A, but stall current can get as high as 1.7 A, which should be taken into account when choosing a motor driver. 

Unloaded speed of these motors will usually be somewhere around 12.000 RPM and 18.000 RPM, the speed will decrease when the motor shaft is loaded, and decrease even more when the traction force of the fluid (water) or the ground is present. The shaft is usually 8 mm long and 2 mm in diameter. Simple press technique is enough to join the wheel or the propeller with the shaft, because these components are most likely made out of relatively soft plastic.

Variable Configuration and Pitch Propeller,"My project is the prototype of a variable geometry propeller.
A non-fixed propeller can change the ""pitch"", meaning the angle, of its blade to change the thrust.
Fundamentally in my project I added another degree of freedom that allows the propeller to change the blades' angle relative to the center of the propeller,
Modifying the angle, which could be called ""configuration"", the blade assume a different section relative to the angle of attack ( which is the angle perpendicular to the air flow).
When the configuration range is wide enough and the diameter of the rotor is suitable,
the speed of the blades' tips can be lowérèd by changing the configuration and this can provide a higher efficiency in multiple use cases.

One of the use cases of my project could be using it in environments with multiple atmospheric densities. Similarly to the NASA's Dragonfly drone, a drone that will land on Titan possibly in about 14 years. ;)


I started the design process while reading 3d printing articles, it took me some time to understand the precision of a 3d printer, although I chosen from the start FDM printing to develop my project.
I did some concept cad model to test the degree of freedom and to see the overall measures; while learning how to modelling, I used Autodesk Inventor.

In the prototype to simplify the process I chosen to use these ""fit"" parameters multiplied to the tolerances to address the printing imprecisions.
(I haven't found any article to do this the right way, so this what I did:)

printTolerance = nozzleDiameter/2        \\Printing tolerance (rule of thumb)
clearanceFit = 1.25        \\Free movement (rotation or sliding)
transitionFit = 0.85        \\Held in place but easy to disassemble
interferenceFit = 0.30        \\No movement, resist force
freeFit = 1.5        \\Free movement (looks good)

If for example I need a printed part that goes in another 3d printed part, the distance between its walls will be
d0 = 2 * printTolerance * [neededFit]


Some design consideration I've made are:
-Pitch arms that pull rather than push in contraposition to the major force to avoid deformation.
- Using 45° angles to avoid supports.
-All ball bearing fixed in place to sustain axial load.
-The shaft is a carbon-fiber tube, to reduce weight, and squared to sustain better radial load and avoid rotation of the pitch and config shafts.
-The bushing around the shaft is 3d printed and have some margin for deformation to account imprecisions (I read about IGUS fila..."

Fairey Huntsman 31 R/C boat,"UPDATE - April, the 19th

You can see vids of the Huntsman running here : https://www.facebook.com/ftm.ftmaventure59/

UPDATE - December, the 16th

My model is now almost finished and the first trials showed a very capable and speed boat! 
So, a few more if you want to try the adventure...
First, and very important : the drive.
There's a steel flexible coupling, 2mm diameter. It turns into a 4mm outside teflon pipe, with silicone grease to limit the water infiltration. As it's VERY flexible, I add a second plain bearing (chaise 2) behind the 28mm propeller and glued under the hull, so the vibrations are limited. A piece of brass tube (outside diameter 3mm) is inserted in the end fitting of the teflon pipe, and in chaise 2. 
The coupling between the engine and the steel flexible is made by two coaxial pieces of brass tube (ext. 3mm in ext. 4mm) tightened by two steel clips (see inside pictures).
Important : the flexible acts like a pump in its sheat, so try to find a propeller that turns in the good way, so no water will enter in the hull by this way.
Inside the boat, two pieces of wood are glued in order to support the 3S 4500mah lipo. Be careful that it isn't too high, as the cockpit is low at this place!
A waterproof box, in front of the engine, contains the receiver and the ESC (the one I chose for his reverse is these : https://www.ebay.com/itm/S-35A-Brushless-ESC-Electric-Speed-Control-5V-2A-BEC-for-Racing-Car-Model-RC723/372465235266?epid=12016014889&hash=item56b8a87542:g:3NwAAOSwArFbvVn8:rk:1:pf:0 )
The trial I made indicates a 1A consumption at about 3 knots, but it can reach more than 15 knots with a max of 11A - 120W.

To give a better appearance, I add a few wood pieces, and made a cramp and a windglass. Please, be better painters than me, as it's a disaster, but at two or three meters it's almost nice...

Last, the name on the rear is very simply printed with the picture conversion of Cura. Type your own name on open office, make a screen capture of it, drag and drop in Cura, and that's done...

Oh, and I forgot : the balcony is made of steel wire, soldered with tin. I thought about print it too, but  I'm afraid it would have been too fragile.

Initial informations:

Inspired by the famous Marc Spital's version, I tried to make a printable version of this superb design boat. 
That's done, but I'm not too proud of the result, as I made her as a volume - can't have a watertight stl as a surface! So, many approximations and awful hacks, but thi..."

Lego Plane 8429,"Here we have another model from my childhood. The Helicopter is the Primary design from the set and the plane is the secondary model. I have built this helicopter model a number of times, although the plane only once. Today was the second time I build the plane, except this time it is virtual.
When I was young this was one of my favourites. At the time it had the most complicated mechanism of all my Lego models. The crank on the side turns both the main rotor and the tail rotor. They are geared so they turn fairly quickly, although this is never going to take off.

The plane is a little simpler, it does not use quite as many components. The kit was forces on the helicopter, but most kits at the time had instructions for multiple models. This one has instructions for the helicopter and the plane. I actually don;t have the instructions for these any more. It took me quite a while searching the internet before I found the instructions online. The wheels on the plane are linked to the propeller on the front. As the plane is pushed along the ground it turn the propeller.
This was modeled in Autodesk Inventor. The level of detail on them is pretty much perfect, right down to the tiny ""LEGO"" text in the studs. If you download the native Inventor files the constraints are setup to work the mechanical linkages. As the files use the same components as my other Lego models you can put them in the folder and the assemblies will share files.
The STEP files can be downloaded separately, while the Inventor files are packaged into individual ZIP files. If you download both you can combine the files."

Portable Water Filter,"Portable Water Filter 

My design is a type of portable water RO filter. I designed this filter using Siemens Solid Edge software. I have used Keyshot Rendering and Solid Edges generative design to optimize my design and make it more presentable. The water purification process it works on is;
1) Filltration (2 layers)
2) Reverse Osmosis (3 layers)
3) Alum Purification (Bottom half of the filter)

My Portable Water Filter consists of 3 main parts that should be 3D printed:
1)	The Main Filter Body
2)	The Main Filter Attachment
3)	The Filter Top

This is to ensure the filter can be assembled and broken down into smaller pieces for better portability. Attachments also ensure better performance, maintainability and a wider range of uses.

The water filter also contains a/an;
1)	Motor and Shaft
2)	Propeller
3)	Propeller Head
4)	Motor Holder
5)	Battery
6)	Power Plug
7)	Solar Panel

11)	3D Printable Filter Case [Cover and Mount] (3)
12)	3 Semipermeable Filters (0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 microns)

It is a highly effective, energy efficient, light and portable way to filter sewage water and use it for the purpose of drinking, bathing and washing. Most of the parts of the filter body only 3D printable.
My design has complied with all the norms and rules set in the problem statement and hasn't infringed on any copyright.

RC Plane Final Summative (TDJ4M0-A),"*UPDATE - CONSTRUCTION + COMPLETED PLANE PICTURES AT THE END*

This is a very time consuming project which incorporates STEM Education and Engineering. 

The wing is modelled by my teacher, instructor, and mentor, https://grabcad.com/shane.anderson-1. The model of the wing is also shared by another student. 

This is a trainer RC Plane designed in the Tech Design course. The task given by my teacher is to design a RC Plane which is to fly to a certain altitude and complete a 3 lap circuit on a 400m track. 

Throughout the course from September until January, I have designed my RC Plane through various sketches and models. I have taken advice from my teacher who has previous knowledge and experience in the construction and flight of RC Planes. 

The wing was constructed during the course, however due to time restrictions the rest of the plane is to be completed during semester 2. 

This model will be updated with photos and videos once the construction and flight of the RC Plane is complete. 

Here is a list of parts that was purchased (the remaining parts are provided) :

Lego Helicopter 8429,"Here we have another model from my childhood. The Helicopter is the Primary design from the set and the plane is the secondary model. I have built this helicopter model a number of times, although the plane only once. Today was the second time I build the plane, except this time it is virtual.
When I was young this was one of my favourites. At the time it had the most complicated mechanism of all my Lego models. The crank on the side turns both the main rotor and the tail rotor. They are geared so they turn fairly quickly, although this is never going to take off.

The plane is a little simpler, it does not use quite as many components. The kit was forces on the helicopter, but most kits at the time had instructions for multiple models. This one has instructions for the helicopter and the plane. I actually don;t have the instructions for these any more. It took me quite a while searching the internet before I found the instructions online. The wheels on the plane are linked to the propeller on the front. As the plane is pushed along the ground it turn the propeller.
This was modeled in Autodesk Inventor. The level of detail on them is pretty much perfect, right down to the tiny ""LEGO"" text in the studs. If you download the native Inventor files the constraints are setup to work the mechanical linkages. As the files use the same components as my other Lego models you can put them in the folder and the assemblies will share files.
The STEP files can be downloaded separately, while the Inventor files are packaged into individual ZIP files. If you download both you can combine the files."

My final entry in this challenge, again related to fluid dynamics, it's a concept I am working on (some of my initial designs: https://grabcad.com/library/canal-turbine-blade-structure-wip-1 (May 2015) and https://grabcad.com/library/turbine-blade-15 (May 2015)) (https://grabcad.com/library/tidal-turbine-fuel-water-vawt-in-hawt-mode-fuel-air-1 (January 2016) and https://grabcad.com/library/tidal-turbine-2 (January 2016)).

This turbine blade also utilizes the concept of leading edge tubercles (https://grabcad.com/library/rear-wing-formula-one-dimensions-2, https://grabcad.com/library/modified-rotor-blade-1, https://grabcad.com/library/modified-helical-darrieus-wind-turbine-blade-1 and https://grabcad.com/library/modified-10x4-7-propeller-1) which makes it more aerodynamically efficient than a similar blade without these tubercles.

This blade is 4.76 in in span. The blade is made up of three different hydrofoils at root, mid section and tip. Blade pitch is ~17 degrees at root and ~3 degrees at the tip in an attempt of keeping the AOA constant (as much as possible) because tip velocities are much higher.

You can put these turbines in irrigation canals and they can power nearby villages and all the irrigation equipment etc. 

There are many advantages of canal turbines over wind turbines, prominent one's being: 

1 No compressibility: 
Water is a lot easier to work with as compressibility is rarely a factor as compared to air.

2. Unidirectional flow 
Water flows in one direction in a canal so we don't need the complicated pitch and yaw control surfaces as in case of wind turbines.

3. Constant flow rate 
We (humans) control water flow rate through canals and it's almost constant throughout the year, so we don't have to worry about blade aero foil design to suit variable/abruptly variable flow rate. 

4. Large Electricity potential 
Canals are 100s of km long, imagine the electricity potential in the canals. You can put these turbines in irrigation canals and it'll power nearby towns/villages and all the irrigation equipment etc.

5. Higher Power/Discharge Ratio 
Water is ~816 times dense (powerful) than air, so for the same discharge (flow) rate we get 816 times more power. Which means more we..."

Diameter: 255 mm
Produces ~10% more thrust and is 8% lighter than a baseline propeller.
Overall efficiency gain 10%

This means direct fuel saving and greener flights. 

For same diameter it can lift more weight or the propeller can be designed smaller in diameter compared to the baseline propeller for the same thrust. The modified propeller has a larger coefficient of thrust than the baseline propeller.

Engineer's toy,"I had the ideles to create a toy of infinite movement. I used the principle of the gyroscope on a geneva wheel to convey the motion to a gear that moves a propeller which in turn moves two balls into a lane. The idea is of the application of one of Newton's laws a moving body tends to remain in motion along with the law of rotation of a gyroscope, I tried to represent an infinite cycle of motion, however, as we know there will be a stop due to friction Due to loss of transmission load.

I used as materials ABS and ABS-PC for 3D printing there are gaps of 0.1 mm

To start the cycle, you must wrap a string around the gyroscope disc as if it were a spinning top, and pull the string to generate the spin.

DM for any further questions.

This is not an improvement over the RAH-66 rotor blades, the black rotor is more efficient than white rotor.

Another entry from the aerodynamics. This time a rotor blade, proportionally similar to the rotor blade they used for the RAH-66. The cross section of the blades is NACA 9410.

Based on the results of https://grabcad.com/library/rear-wing-formula-one-dimensions-2, I chose an amplitude of tubercles to be 20% of the chord length. A basic CFD analysis shows a strong improvement in thrust to torque ratio of the modified rotor when compared with the baseline model. The modified rotor produces more thrust at an rpm and requires less torque from the engine to achieve that rpm. The modified rotor produces more thrust at a lower rpm than the baseline model and requires significantly less torque from the engine to achieve that rpm (less rpm).

Both of these rotors are 9.9 in in diameter. Baseline model files are also attached, if the anyone/jury wants to run their own CFD analysis.

I have no access to a 3D printer, you can print this model in one third and use adhesives to join the three parts, taking advantage of the circular symmetry.

Avia BH-3 Czech fighter,"Lovely GrabCAD'ers,

this is a (rough) model of the Avia BH-3. This plane was probably the first Czech fighter plane made. It is based on its two previous models; the BH-1 and BH-2, which were sport planes. It has a length of 7 meters and was about 10 meters wide. It's power came from a 4-inline engine, which was called the IIIa and had about 185 HP. (Not included) Two of the .303 Vickers were placed on the nose for shooting the enemy planes down. Only 14 of the BH-3 were made. (Source: wikipedia.)

I had somewhat a hard time finding information and clear images of this model, but it was a fun modeling experience. I put on a camouflage with the RGB-colors of the middle plane in the comparison.jpg. The reason I picked out this plane, was because it had a very special ""nose"" with exhaustpipes sticking out on one side. I was pretty sure none else modeled this one too, so why not give it a shot?

Twice Lift Improved Propeller,"27 N of force at 9644 RPM, Three Blades Propeller.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~V-3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I dragged on that extrusion pattern along the entire blade. What I think that was happened is that now the air moves over the top surface even faster than before and creating much lower pressure. Compared with the best propeller design with the same size that I could find, this propeller generate 400% more lift. According to the simulation, the conventional propeller generate around 7N of lift meanwhile this one generate 22N. Now, personally I don't trust too much in the simulation so until someone (or even me) could make a real prototype and test it, I can't promise anything. I hope helped somebody.
------------------------V-2------------------------
I made some modifications to the model, and the simulation says that the force has increased and the average turbulence has decreased. If someone has any ideas to improve it I'm open to suggestions :D

It could be manufactured by using any 3d printable technology, however i would recommend stereolithography (SLA) as a preferred manufacturing method.
The model it is designed to revolve and be functional, for this you should insert in the base a rubber band as shown in the picture ""rubber band placement (on the base)"".
For an more accurate depiction and resemblance with the Da Vinci drawing, insert two more rubber bands on the center pole to connect with the sheet support ends, as shown in the picture ""rubber band placement (on the pole and sheet support)"".
The sheet parts may not be 3D printed, you could replace them with sheets of paper and glue them into place. Cellophane or aluminium wrapping sheets could also be used."

Safety Performance Shroud,"Safety Performance Shroud (SPS)
*Designed to be printed in nylon using FDM with the shroud inlet oriented downward.
*Requires support material or breakaway support structures.
*Improves safety and performance of multi-rotors in any industry, but is ideal for applications that require a close proximity to people and/or involve hovering for the majority of the time (ie photography or video recording).

Two primary concerns for multi-rotor operators are performance and safety. Multiple designs for propeller guards exist on all sizes of multi-rotors, but they all share the disadvantage that the improved safety must come at the price of adding dead weight. This added weight hinders endurance and the craft’s maneuverability, which in turn can have its own negative impacts on the safety of those nearby. Research has found that, for a given propeller diameter, a properly designed shroud can result in substantial gains in thrust and efficiency (Jason L. Pereira 2008), however, the difficulty comes in manufacturing such a shroud that is light enough to realize those gains.

 The first challenge is aerodynamic. With advances in the precision of FDM manufacturing, the shroud can be printed as a thin hollow shell. This is ideal, because the shroud, like skin on conventional aircraft, need only be strong enough to support its own weight and hold its shape against the aerodynamic forces it will encounter in flight. Next the motor mount, with the support legs doubling as stators, and the bracket for attaching the shroud to the airframe can easily be printed as one piece with the use of support material or breakaway support structures.

 The final hurdle is structural. With the skin being printed so thin, there must be additional support. Doubling the skin thickness would likewise double the weight, so another approach must be taken. This is where the capabilities of 3D printing are best utilized. A hexagonal arrangement of triangular support arches strengthen the inlet and keep it rigid. Additionally, a support ring strengthens the bottom lip, removing the need for dedicated landing gear. Both of these internal support structures are designed to be lightweight, and completely self-supporting, so that zero support material must be used inside the shroud. This results in a simpler and faster print process.
 
 In terms of numbers, the original front arm on the Horus weighs about 0.1 lbs depending on the type of carbon fiber. Using Nylon 11 with an optimized sup..."

Total weight using recommended infills is about 415g, 519g with battery. I get between 6-10 min of time based on flying style.

2x Deck Cam
1x Deck
1x ESC Holder
6x Landing Legs
4x Arm Holders
4x Arms
Gone thought about 10 pairs of propellers.

## UPDATE ##
I have revised the files, I now only use the base from thingverse, which has been made slightly longer. I have a top cover now, propeller guards and new mounting methods for electronics. It seems the most common part to break are the arms, second by the base.

## COMMENTS ##

I have now included my *.uav settings file on here. You may use it to program you CC3D quad copter made using these pieces. I still got some tuning to do on the pitch flips, but should give you a good 2 weeks for research head start. Most of these parts can be printed with a 15-20% infill. ABS/PLA, doesn't really matter much. I would recommend 80% infill on the base and arms.

It's a concept I am working on. 

You can put these turbines in irrigation canals and it'll power nearby villages and all the irrigation equipment etc.

Advantages over wind: unidirectional flow (water flows in one direction in a canal) so we don't need pitch and yaw control surfaces, constant flow rate, we (humans) control water flow rate through canals and it's same all year, so we don't have to worry about blade aero foil design to suit variable flow rate as it is in case of wind (multi directional, and variable speed flow), that makes design very simple and cost effective.

Canals are 100s of km long, imagine the electricity potential in the canals. and Water is 816 times dense (powerful) than air!

Double Cardan Shaft,"- This configuration uses two U-joints joined by an intermediate shaft, with the second U-joint phased in relation to the first U-joint to cancel the changing angular velocity. In this configuration, the angular velocity of the driven shaft will match that of the driving shaft, provided that both the driving shaft and the driven shaft are at equal angles with respect to the intermediate shaft (but not necessarily in the same plane) and that the two universal joints are 90 degrees out of phase.

Propeller Toy,"This is a toy I designed to teach kids about engineering. It can be 3D printed on Stratasys printers with water soluble supports (because the handle and spinner are printed together and can't be assembled). I used this model to show a flow analysis, stress analysis and plastic injection molding prediction analysis (even though I know it's not designed for injection molding). It's a heck of a good time to play with too! With a strong small rope a little thicker than kite string about 3' long you should be able to get the propeller to fly over 100'. Tip: put a little light weight oil where the spinner shaft meets the handle for best results. The oil also helps keep the plastic from getting hot and becoming welded together when you spin it. Have fun!

If you open it in SOLIDWORKS to look how I built the model, I will tell you that I wanted the propeller to spin counter-clockwise but I wasn't thinking about that when I made the first blade so I originally built it backwards. Instead of going back and redoing all the sketches to make the blade, I just mirrored it and used some surfacing tools to connect it back to the hub."
Terrafugia TF-X Flying Formula,"Beyond the lovely fantasies of sci-fi until someone invents an anti-gravity device the two main poles of designing a flying machine are:
- As light as possible
- More penetrating in the air as possible, consistent with greater lift force.

The silhouette of a normal car is unlikely to satisfy these two conditions, which for returning to the root of the problem Terrafugia is a medium that must carry two or four people from one place to another passing through the sky and streets.
The optimization balance of the two needs is the goal to achieve,
and certainly favor one of the two penalizes the other.
But we must ask: what is the most beneficial aspect of the two?
It is definitely moving in the sky;
- Greater distance traveled per unit of time
- Higher speed
- Lower consumption / path.
In my opinion, should give priority to move in the sky where I think this vehicle will be used for at least 90% of the space to go. 
In fact, no one would take it to move usually in an urban space taking a walk wtih a pair of wings  and three engines in more.
I then used a glider fuselage that can accommodate two people and allow maximum penetration.
With this choice, you also get more space to fold the wings close to the body and more space to fold the blades of the engines of vertical takeoff. 
The diameter of the rotors increases compared to the previous   my solution:
https://grabcad.com/library/terrafugia-tf-x-concept-1
that  was provided housing  four person.
We must not forget that the maximum lifting capacity is required for vertical take-off, and is entrusted exclusively by the traction of the two rotors, that we know are not simple propellers but rotating wings. Therefore, consistent with the need to retreat the rotors to get into a garage, must have the maximum possible diameter.
The other choice  is between three or four wheels. 
I think that  the three-wheeler solution is less bulky and less heavy and creates less resistance in air motion.
Moreover, even for moving on the road are more than enough.
 This is demonstrated by  Aptera choices: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBe7JXDTrFw 
In fact I have to say that it would be desirable to have a collaboration between Terrafugia and Aptera, just add wings!

Terra Fugia-Flying CAR-Machozz,"Designs will  come whenever the imaginations have gone through a series of thoughts.
This concept has air intake through the car grille and exit through the rear duct.
vertical take-off and runway take-off both possible according to the situation.
The side rotor capsule  will come to occupy in the side provision during road journey, It can carry 4 passengers at a time.   
This concept has an engine placed rear part of the vehicle exactly back to rear passenger seat.The same engine will give power to the rear wheels as well as the rear duct fan.
The engine will charge a set of light weight batteries,which will give electricity to thepropeller on both sides.Actually the propeller powered by light weight,high torque and heavy duty electric brushless motors.So the size of the rotor capsule is smaller compared to existing propeller.
The tyre will get folded inside the vehicle by hydraulic mechanism.
The tyres are covered by some kind of flexible plastics it will open whenever on road conditions arise.
The place where the rotor capsules rests is also covered with stretchable plastics or clothes.
 Air passages inside the vehicle will give sufficient air to the duct and engine systems.
The interesting part of my design is I made my concept as keeping as car is base and then a flying machine.If we make a flight to a car, simply is not good in actual road condition.The quadrocopter is best suitable as a flying matching nowadays.
Actually the concept is focusing on duct fan is for low speed application.Here I used the side propellers for both vertical as well as normal horizontal flight.
Expecting future will have these cars in operation."
Terrafugia TF-X Flying wing concept,"One of the major problems of the Terrafugia TF-X concept  is the size of the wings that must have sufficient surface area for the sustenance and can be folded to fit inside a garage. 
So I decided for wing Prandtl type that has small size and excellent lift. 
It came out this cross between a Prandtl wing, a flying wing Horten and the last recent Agusta Westland Project Zero, that everything can fly is to prove ...
Unfortunately with so complex wings I could not find a possibility of folding, and can not get into a garage and not moving on a road.
It can then be converted as a large vertical take-off drone .

Terrafugia TF-X concept,"For the study of this project I followed the guidelines proposed by Terrafugia: 

Design guidelines: 
- Maintain the basic TF-X ™ configuration (rear ducted fan and high folding wing with pivoting motor pods). 
- Fit inside a 19 'x 8' x 7 'tall box (ie garage) when in ""car mode."" 

I expected four seats, so I left the size of the seats: 
I used the seats: 
https://grabcad.com/library/helicopter-crew-seat-1 
https://grabcad.com/santosh.kumar-12 
that are very well designed and dimensioned for use in aviation. 
From small size limits allowed by the garage are derived all other dimensions. 
The two rear drive wheels are matched very close together and come out from a differential connected directly to the engine, the whole is articulated on a swinging arm as is explained on my previous model: 
https://grabcad.com/library/trike-2040 from which was derived the transmission.

The size of the project file is very large, I saved in STEP format and compressed and dividing it with .rar

However, to allow a three-dimensional view of the project I saved in PDF format 3D. It is available for download and visible with Acrobat Reader.

Propfan,"A propfan is a type of aircraft engine related in concept to both the turboprop and turbofan, but distinct from both. The engine uses a gas turbine to drive an unshielded propeller like a turboprop, but the propeller itself is designed with a large number of short, highly twisted blades, similar to a turbofan's bypass compressor 
The propfan engine is designed to have the speed and performance of a turbofan, but the fuel efficiency of a turboprop. The propfan is also known as the unducted fan (UDF) engine because the fan is not enclosed like that of a turbofan. The propulsive efficiency of a propfan engine is increased by the high bypass ratio achieved using external fan blades. The efficiency boost is maintained even at high speeds because the fan blades are curved like scimitars to prevent shockwave formation on the outer tips of the blades. The increased propulsive efficiencies translate into overall propulsive efficiency gains of as much as 20-25% over turbofans. "

I then imported them into Solidworks and lofted them together to create the propeller.

The airfoil, chord, and betas are correct, however the positioning of each slice is estimated with a two part piecewise functions.

Please note that unlike my other propellers, this one has been thickened to ease 3d printing."
Kids to Work Day ROV,"This is a drawing set I put together to model the basic components of an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) that we are having kids put together on ""Take Your Kid to Work Day"" at our plant.

The included powerpoint document (ROV Assy Instructions.pptx) shows the step-by-step assembly of the hardware.  I may extend this sometime in the future to include the wiring and maybe also the control box.

At this initial point, we are discovering we may need to move the Port & Stbd thrusters up to the vertical columns, as they act like levers and cause the ROV to rapidly surface.

When we do the day, I'll try to grab some video and include that, too...

Toy Jet,"A jet aircraft (or simply jet) is an aircraft (nearly always a fixed-wing aircraft) propelled by jet engines. Jet aircraft generally fly much faster than propeller-powered aircraft and at higher altitudes – as high as 10,000–15,000 metres (33,000–49,000 ft). At these altitudes, jet engines achieve maximum efficiency over long distances. The engines in propeller-powered aircraft achieve their maximum efficiency at much lower altitudes. Some jet aircraft can move faster than sound.
Frank Whittle, an English inventor and RAF officer, developed the concept of the jet engine in 1928,[1] Hans von Ohain in Germany, a decade later developed the concept independently at the end of the 1930s. He wrote in February 1936 to Ernst Heinkel, telling him of the design and its possibilities. However, it can be argued that the English engineer A. A. Griffith, who published a paper in July 1926 on compressors and turbines, also deserves credit."

OS .25 SF ABC Engine with pipe exhaust,"This pipe increased the power of the engine from 0,79 HP and (with 15% Nitro fuel and 18% oil) to an amazing 1,45 HP (with just 5% Nitro fuel and 23% oil). 
I had to decrease the compression ratio from 10:1 to 7:1 to reach the best performance and safer running conditions and durability.
Idle rpm decreased from 2500 rpm to 1450 rpm, keeping a steady and relyable behaviour and great reaction!!
I have reached the best conditions with a 9,5"" * 5"" propeller and 14.000 rpm.
The pipe exhaust was made in duraluminium, 0,5 mm thick, and assembled from 3 pieces. The pressure inyector to the tank was placed in the bigger diameter sector of the pipe. To avoid the plane to get contaminated with oil from the exhaust, I placed a silicone exhaust extension at the end, with no power loses. 
The results: amazing sound, reliable running, lot of extra power, cleaner running, the best reaction, and many people amazed around every time I run the engine.
I hope this work could be useful to many people in the site!

Daniel."

Spitfire Chair Project,"The base is from GrabCAD via Terry Stonehocker Labelled Q6 in the attached step file (http://grabcad.com/library/q6-power-base-1)

The chair is based on a spitfire plane cockpit chair, with a few mods (one being the upholstery and the other the propeller at the back). My aim was so that you could adapt just a few parts, and pick up the rest from old parts that had character. 

The propeller at the back can be used with a small DC motor linked to the supply from Q6. I designed it originally to link up with the wheel through a number of cogs and friction pads, but you need to have on or off function that’s easy to control  to save battery power. The main idea is that when you are moving along and the propeller is rotating, it will look like the propeller is moving it along. 

The gear combo drives propeller with quite a slow ratio with what’s on there at the moment. This is just really for show and safety. You could easily swop the ratio over, but you would probably take off the ground at some point. 

The seat has a slot hole which can be covered by glass or changed for safety reasons.

The upholstery is one part that would have to be made especially for this, and it could be adapted to suite posture and comfort. The controls could easily be swapped from the original base, and wiring could be dealt very easily through the upholstery. The controls could also be pulled from an old plane, such as the control stick or maybe some of the more interesting functions like engine start or oil temp switches and labels.

One final note: You could even use some welding or flying goggles along with an old jacket that has character. There is also room for the belts that you get when you clip your self into the cockpit seat. 
 

Enjoy!

Pull Cord Helicopter Toy,"No secondary materials! No glue! Simple five piece assembly! 100% 3D printable! Easy snap-together parts!

When I saw the Ultimaker 3D Printer Toy Design Challenge, I knew I had an opportunity to create something new and exciting, something to show the continuing progress of this technology. I set out to design a toy that could be printed in its entirety, would be interactive and fun, and wouldn't require any bolts, glue, rubber bands to assemble. I also designed all parts to fit in a 6x6 build space so that people with smaller build areas could still print this object, and people with large build areas wouldn’t have to fight warping as much.

Enter the pull cord helicopter! As a kid, I had one that had a string pull cord. I wanted to design a 3D printable rack-and-pinion for it, but alas! I was limited to 21cm, hardly long enough to get a good pull in. I came up with the idea of coiling the rack into a spiral, with the idea that it would be thin and flexible enough post-print to be uncoiled for use! 

It took many iterations to design a 3D printable pull cord that wouldn’t break between gear teeth but would still be flexible enough to unbend out of the coil shape. Printing this part in Taulman’s nylon is a perfect application for this material, as it is rugged and durable, and yet has no problem bending out of the coil shape it is printed in. In addition, the slipperiness of the nylon makes for VERY smooth pulling against the gearshaft.


Print settings and materials:

Cool Wind ,"This project is a Velodroom Light add-on.

Sometimes, the wind works against the cyclist. Now I ask you, why don’t we put that wind power into use? With this cool add-on, it will harness the wind's energy and convert it into useful power. 

Having a hectic schedule, you might forget or maybe just too lazy to charge your Velodroom Light. With it unpowered, the bicycle rider’ visibility decreases especially in dark conditions. That should never be an option because we all know there are many crazy drivers around. You will never again have to worry about running out of power. 

Not only that, you can also change the blades' color to your own liking. Match it with your bike, clothes, packs, or any other accessories!

How It Works
It is made out of lightweight and durable plastic. The setup will also include a turbine. This turbine which is connected to the blade will convert the kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy. Then, the mechanical energy will be converted into electricity using a generator. As a result, this will provide us with sufficient energy to charge the Velodroom Light.

Graupner O.S. 3825-750Kv OMA high-performance motors,"High-Powered Brushless Aircraft Motors from O.S.!
Pilots loyal to outstanding O.S. performance but eager to fly electric will now have the ideal option — powering electric airplanes using new O.S. Brushless Motors!

The OS OMA-3825-750Kv High Performance Brushless Motor is designed equivalent for 2-stroke 25~30 size airplanes.

Designed by O.S. engineers to be the new ""gold standard"" in electric power, these motors offer the same legendary quality and reliability that have made O.S. glow engines famous worldwide for 75 years. Initially, the motors are being produced in 6 sizes, equivalent to .10,.15,.25, .30, .40 and .50 size glow engines. 

Only O.S. brushless motors will offer a ventilation system that increases efficiency and allows the motors to generate additional power. Key to this system is a unique centrifugal fan design. The fan draws air through specially angled ventilation holes, across the windings and over the magnets for greatly improved cooling.

9x4.7 Propeller,"A 9x4.7 propeller for airplane and multicopter designs.

I created a ruby script that uses prop geometry from http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/props/propDB.html and airfoil geometry from http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=naca4412-il to create 2d slices of the propeller. I then imported them into Solidworks and lofted them together to create the propeller.

The airfoil, chord, and betas are correct, however the positioning of each slice is estimated with two piecewise functions.

UPDATE: I got rid of the wonky hub connection and now the blade is all one loft. Yay! I also updated the blade geometry so it is all one airfoil shape (NACA 4412). I had squished the airfoil in the thicker regions in the previous version.

UPDATE: Reworked my code and the propeller is much more accurate. I went back to squished airfoils b/c it was getting too thick -- 3mm at some points.

Modeled in SolidWorks, Imported to C4D, Rendered with Redshift. Cheers !    ~Dave

Hello Friends,  I finally finished my radial engine model and renders. Of course most of you will recognize this engine as the Karl-Erik Olsryd 9-cylinder quarter scale model of the Wright J-5 Whirlwind. I modeled it from the drawings by Jan Elg, deviating a bit from the drawings only when I felt it would benefit form or function.

The Solidworks 2013 model is complete with all Mechanical Mates. You can turn the propeller and and see all the workings of the complete valve train, intake blower, gear box, distributor, planetary gears, etc. One exception is the valve springs. I have included them in the model but Solidworks could not handle the additional dynamics of 18 functioning valve springs.

Credits: The model is mine complete with the exception of the carbureator and propeller. Credit for the carbureator goes to Jan Elg and the propeller is from Grabcad user Usama. Thanks to both.

I'm uploading my complete Solidworks 2013 files, parts & assemblies, as well as STEP, IGES, STL and several high resolution renderings I created with Bunkspeed Shot. Click the Download button to see them in Hi-Res glory!

Small Airplane Propeller,"This is propeller i made for my Continental C90/O-200, as no one could give me propeller to cut it in 10 pieces and take dimensions, i used what I could from Internet. Propellers like these are used for airplanes such as Cessna 150 etc, with air cooled engines. The fact that its air cooled means propeller it self has 2 main reasons to cover:
1.) To make airplane move
2.) To  cool the engine
That leads to part where propeller is kinda in 2 parts; part closer to center is made so it cools engine, outside part is made to make airplane move. 

There are basically 2 kinds of propellers, first kind is like I have now, its for lower speeds but great torque and other kind, with more aggressive attack angle is made for greater speeds, but with that - lower acceleration. 

I will maybe make guide with things I learned when I made it and things to keep in mind and few tricks aswell, later on, when I will have some time. 

Materials used to make propellers like this are different, but it goes all the way from wood to carbon, covering steel in the middle. 

Diameter of propeller is 1860mm. 

It does not have changeable pitch, as airplane is small, engine doesn't support it and it just doesn't need this function, as that would only make things way more complicated and heavy. "

3DPrintingEvent Wind Mill,"A 3D-Printer offers unique manufacturing capabilities. Complicated parts can be manufactured without having to design and manufacture complicated tools. The following proposal seeks to use exactly this capability in order to manufacture a simple and small wind mill. The mill can power small generators (such as the Shimano DH-3N20) or pumps in remote locations or third world countries. Designing, manufacturing and testing this machine will definitely inspire a lot of kids to maybe become engineers. Using 3D printing offers unique flexibility. 
The blades and their shape definitely belong to the more complicated parts. They are designed using the open source propeller design software supplied by Dr. Martin Hepperle (http://www.mh-aerotools.de/airfoils/javaprop.htm). All parts are printable within the available machining space. The design is by no means completed (time… ;)), but should show the principle. 
In the above images, printed parts are colored red, standard part yellow. "

Supermarine Spitfire Mk VIII,"This is my tribute to the Supermarine Spitfire - one of (if not the most) iconic planes of all time.
Its not 100% accurate but I have tried to get it as close to the MKVIII as I can.
It was modelled in Solidworks and is all mated in such a way that the rudder, ailerons, and elevators all move how they should so you can position it if you wish. 
There is also 2 configurations - ""landing gear up"" and ""landing gear down"".
The propeller also has its own configurations for the number of blades - 2,3,4,and even 5 (although I think the real thing either had 3 or 4 depending on its set up).

DARRIEUS wind turbine,"The Darrieus wind turbine is a type of vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) used to generate electricity from the energy carried in the wind.

This design of wind turbine was patented by Georges Jean Marie Darrieus, a French aeronautical engineer in 1931.
The Darrieus type is theoretically just as efficient as the propeller type if wind speed is constant, but in practice this efficiency is rarely realised due to the physical stresses and limitations imposed by a practical design and wind speed variation. There are also major difficulties in protecting the Darrieus turbine from extreme wind conditions and in making it self-starting.

Swept profile propeller blade,"This is my first propeller design.  I actually designed it backwards, so if you are thinking of using it, don't!  The idea was to use a conventional set of airfoils near the root, and transition to supercritical airfoils near the tip.  This, with the swept profile, would allow for a higher rotation speed, and therefore more thrust and a higher aircraft speed.  Problem is, I used supercritical sections near the root, and transitioned to standard 6 series  foils at the tip.  As you can see, I'm dyslexic...  Anyway, it still looks pretty cool, and is usable, so I thought I'd post it.  This is my first ""good"" solidworks model, so if any of you experts out there have some suggestions of how I can smooth out some of the lumpiness, I would appreciate it.  "
